                            <span className='loaderdoido'></span> My name is Ayush Kumar. I’m 19 years old and I’m from New Delhi, India. Yes, you heard that right — I am a Creative Frontend Developer (addict). <span className='loaderdoi'></span> and I work as a freelancer. I specialize in converting designs into pixel-perfect, high-performance, accessible, and responsive websites. I have a strong enthusiasm for the entire development spectrum, which keeps me actively engaged in my work. When I'm not creating or exploring new experiences online, you can likely find me reading a book or listening to music.
